## My Virtual Machines Running in UTM

This screenshot shows the current state of my lab environment. 

For this project, I am running two virtual machines inside UTM:

- **DC01** - Windows Server 2022 (Active Directory Domain Services + DNS)
- **WIN11-01** - Windows 11 Enterprise (domain-joined workstation)

These two machines form the foundation of the lab, allowing me to test:
- Active Directory domain structure
- DNS resolution and domain controller discovery
- Group Policy creation and application
- Client-server authentication flows
